# Developing this library

Cloudant Sync - Android is written in Java and uses
[gradle](http://www.gradle.org) as its build tool.

## Requirements

The main requirements are:

* Java 1.6
* Android SDK

Optionally, and recommended:

* CouchDB

## Coding guidelines

Adopting the [Google Java Style](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html)
with the following changes:

```
4.2 
    Our block indent is +4 characters

4.4
    Our line length is 100 characters.

4.5.2
    Indent continuation of +4 characters fine, but I think 
    IDEA defaults to 8, which is okay too.
```

## Installing requirements

### Java

Follow the instructions for your platform.


### CouchDB

Again, using brew:

```bash
$ brew install couchdb
```

### Android SDK

Follow the instructions provided on the android developer site.

## Building the library

The project should build out of the box with:

```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```

Note: for windows machines the script to run is `gradlew.bat`.

This will download the dependencies, build the library and run the unit
tests.

If you want to use the library in other projects, install it to your local
maven repository:

```bash
$ gradlew install
```

### Running integration tests

These require a running couchdb:

```bash
$ couchdb
Apache CouchDB 1.3.1 (LogLevel=info) is starting.
Apache CouchDB has started. Time to relax.
[info] [<0.31.0>] Apache CouchDB has started on http://127.0.0.1:5984/
```

And in another terminal:

```bash
$ ./gradlew integrationTest
```

#### Running integration tests on Android


Running the integration tests on android requires the running of a dedicated test app,
in addition to the requirements for Java SE integration tests.

SQLCipher, an open source extension to SQLite that provides database encryption, is also
required.  The latest binary packages (.jar and .so files) can be found here:
https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher

After downloading, move all folders containing .so files and the 'sqlcipher.jar' under
'src/main/jniLibs' in the AndroidTest directory.  Then, move the 'icudt46l.zip' to '/src/main/assets'.
Finally, open the module settings for the AndroidTest app and add the 'sqlcipher.jar' to the dependency list.
[SQLCipher]: https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/


The test application build scripts require a running emulator and the ```ANDROID_HOME```
 environment variable to be set

The minimum requirements for an android emulator:

* Minimum API Level 15 (Target API Level is 20)
* An SD card

This test app can be run via gradle (in the AndroidTest directory of your checkout)


```bash
$ ../gradlew clean installStandardTestDebug waitForTestAppToFinishTests
```
The app will run all tests on specified by the build variant on first start up, to rerun tests
you must rerun the gradle build.

#### Collecting Test Results

Test Results are displayed via the app, a test report is also available for CI builds.
The test result report is in the same format as the ANT JUnit task reports. These style reports can be interpreted by 
Jenkins and other systems.  The reports are located under the ``` build/test-results/ ``` the file name is automatically generated 
by the build scripts, the base file name is ```testResults_``` it is suffixed with a UUID for that build.


#### Testing using remote CouchDB Instance

Certain tests need a running CouchDB instance, by default they use the local
CouchDB. To run tests with a remote CouchDB, you need set the details of this CouchDB server, including access credentials: add the following to `gradle.properties` in the same folder as
`build.gradle`:

```
systemProp.test.with.specified.couch=[true|false] # default false
systemProp.test.couch.username=yourUsername 
systemProp.test.couch.password=yourPassword
systemProp.test.couch.host=couchdbHost # default localhost
systemProptest.couch.port=couchdbPort # default 5984
systemProp.test.couch.http=[http|https] # default 5984
systemProp.test.couch.ignore.compaction=[true|false] # default false
systemProp.test.couch.auth.headers=[true|false] # default false
```
Note: some tests need to be ignored based on the configuration of the CouchDB instance you are using or if you are running against Cloudant. For example if the compaction endpoint is unavailable eg returns a 403 response, these tests should be disabled. 

Your gradle.properties should NEVER be checked into git repo as it contains your CouchDB credentials.

#### Testing with SQLCipher encryption
To run integration tests using the SQLCipher-based database, add the following JVM argument to 'gradle.properties':
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dtest.sqlcipher.passphrase=true

#### Testing under a single package
For running tests under a specific package, add the JVM argument 'test.run-packages' to 'gradle.properties' with
the package name as the value.  Example below for running tests under the 'sync/datastore' package:
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Dtest.run-packages=datastore


### Code coverage

To get code coverage, you need the `coberturaReport` task before the tests you want to run:

```bash
$ ./gradlew coberturaReport test
$ ./gradlew coberturaReport integrationTest
$ ./gradlew coberturaReport systemTest
```

Code coverage metrics end up in `build/reports`.

## Using IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio

For IDEA, the best way to get everything set up correctly is to use
IDEA's JetGradle plugin to automatically generate and configure an
IDEA project. IDEA will then keep the project in sync with the
`build.gradle` file.

Install this via Preferences -> Plugins (under IDE Settings) -> Gradle.

For Android Studio, this plugin is already installed.

You can then use File -> Import Project (Import Project or Import
Non-Android Studio project from the Welcome dialog) to create the IDEA
/ Android Studio project, which will allow you to run gradle tasks
from IDEA / Android Studio in addition to setting up dependencies
correctly. Just select the `build.gradle` file from the root of the
project directory in the Import dialog box and select the default
settings.

In Android Studio, a message may appear showing 'Frameworks detected:
Android framework is detected in the project'. This can be safely
dismissed as the library should *not* be built against the Android
framework - it is a standard Java SE project.

After importing the gradle project you may need to configure the
correct SDK. This can be set from the File -> Project Structure
dialog. In the Project Settings -> Project tab. If the selected entry
in the Project SDK dropdown is `<No SDK>`, then change it to an
appropriate Java SDK such as 1.6 or 1.7.

An alternative is to use gradle itself, which is also able to generate an idea project.

```bash
$ ./gradlew idea
```

See [Gradle's IDEA plugin docs](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/idea_plugin.html).

### Code Style

An IDEA code style matching the guidelines above is included in the project,
in the `.idea` folder.

If you already have the project, enable the code style follow these steps:

1. Go to _Preferences_ -> _Editor_ -> _Code Style_.
2. In the _Scheme_ dropdown, select _Project_.

IDEA will then use the style when reformatting, refactoring and so on.


### Running JUnit tests in the IDE

To run JUnit tests from Android Studio / IDEA, you will need to add some configuration to tell it
where the SQLite native library lives.

* In the menu, select Run -> Edit Configurations
* In the left hand pane, select Defaults -> JUnit
* Set VM options to:
```
-ea -Dsqlite4java.library.path=native
```
